        <h1>The story of book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been stering out of her window for about an hour now.On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>,<i>New scientist</i>,and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Roal.</cite>
           It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneerting work, unraveling the secrects
         of the lama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleric acid">DNA</abbr>,to be an outstanding achievement , Molly <em>did</em> thik she had something better to do.</p>
